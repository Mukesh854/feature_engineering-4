    "Ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in the dataset.\n",
    "The integers assigned are ordered in a meaningful way, implying some sort of hierarchy or order among the categories.\n",
    "This encoding is typically used when there is a clear ordinal relationship among the categories. For example, categories like \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" can be encoded as 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Label encoding also assigns a unique integer value to each category in the dataset.\n",
    "However, unlike ordinal encoding, label encoding does not imply any ordinal relationship among the categories. It simply assigns a unique integer to each category without considering any order.\n",
    "This encoding is generally used when the categories are nominal and there is no inherent order among them.\n",

    "For Example  let's  suppose we have a dataset in which we have a feature named size in this feature we have a size  of t-shirt small , medium , large\n",
